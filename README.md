# ng-signal-pagination

A pagination component that:

- uses Angular's signals all the way
- works with in-memory collections as well as retrieving data async
- is tailored for styling with Tailwind
- is type-safe

## Roadmap

- easy integration with [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/angular/overview) would be nice

```html
<ng-signal-pagination [query]="productsQuery" />
```
