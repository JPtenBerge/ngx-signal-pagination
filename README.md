# ng-signal-pagination

A pagination component that:

- uses Angular's signals all the way
- works with in-memory collections as well as retrieving 
- is tailored for styling with Tailwind
- is type-safe

## Roadmap

- Easy integration with TanStack Query would be nice

```html
<ng-signal-pagination [query]="productsQuery" />
```
